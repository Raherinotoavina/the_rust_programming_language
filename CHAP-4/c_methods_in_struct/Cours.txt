# Methods in Struct
- It's similare to function.
- We declare them with the fn keywords and a name.
- Can have parameter and a return value.
- Contrairement aux fonctions, les méthodes sont définies dans le contexte d'une structure
(or enum, or a trait of object).
- THEIR FIRST PARAMETER IS ALWAYS "SELF" 
    => Represent the instance of the struct the method is being called on.

## Good to know
- All function defined within an impl block are called associated functions because they're
with the type named after the impl.
- We can defined associated function that don't have self as their first parameter.
    => "THUS ARE NOT METHODS"
    => Because they don't need an instance of the type to work with.
    => For example String::from
- Associated functions that aren’t methods are often used for constructors that will return a new instance of the struct.
- To call this associated function we use the following command "Object::method(parameter)".
