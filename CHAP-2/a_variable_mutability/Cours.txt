//// VARIABLES
- By default variable are immutable.

//// WHAT IS IMMUTABILITY
- When a variable is assigned to a value, it's can't be change anywhere.

//// HOW TO CHANGE VARIABLE TO MUTABLE
- Command : let mut x = 5;

//// WHERE IS THE CONSTANT KEYWORD
- Command : const CONSTANTE:i32 = 5;
- We can not use the "mut" keyword in constant
- Always immutable
- We need to annotated the type of value when we use "const"
- For convention constant is ALL UPPERCASE

//// WHAT IS SHADOWING ?
- In rust we can declare a variable with the same name

//// CAN WE DON'T USE LET OR CONST TO DECLARE VARIABLE ?
- NO!!!!!!!!!
