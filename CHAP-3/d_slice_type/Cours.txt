# SLICE TYPE
## Definition
- Let you reference a contiguous sequence of elements in a collection rather than the whole collection.
- A slice is a kind of reference, so it does not have ownership.

## String slice
- A reference to a part of a String
    => &s[startIndex..endIndex]
- If you start with the index 0, you can not write it 
    => &s[..4]
- It's also like this if you end at the end of string
    => &s[5..]
- If you would to drop all the string
    => &s[..]

## GOOD TO KNOW
- To convert a string to an array of byte
    => String::new("Hello").as_byte();
- To iter a collection
    => collection.iter()
- To wrap the result of iter and return each element as part of tuple (index, reference to each element)
    => collection.iter().collection()
- To clear a string
    => String::new("Hello").clear()
